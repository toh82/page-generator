Pagegenerator
===
The Pagegenerator webapp should help to build easy storeable and nice looking pages.

Proper use case is for example Magento, which has a poor page engine. With Pagegenerator implemented, you can use custom content elements while the whole page is stored as json in the Magento content field. To render the output, pass the json to Pagegenerator render interface and it will give you back the rendered html.

Current status: basic file setup (WIP).
